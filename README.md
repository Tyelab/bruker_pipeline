# twop_data_dev
Manipulation of two photon microscopy data. To be incorporated in broader pipeline later.

Repo will be used for automatic image ripping from Bruker 2P microscope, conversion of individual tiffs into H5/zarr file formats, and make available datasets for an automated 2P pipeline likely using CaImAn. Given that the lab wants to move into Voltage Imaging and CaImAn has support already for voltage data, it makes sense to adopt their platform.
