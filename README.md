# Bruker Pipeline
Repository for Bruker Ultima data processing for datasests generated via bruker_control.

Repo will be used for automatic image ripping from Bruker 2P microscope, conversion of individual tiffs into HDF5 file formats, and make available datasets for an automated 2P pipeline using Suite2P and CaImAn. There has not been an independent analysis comparing the two packages and their algorithms. For now, per Austin Coley PhDs request, we will use Suite2P for team specialk's data pipeline. CaImAn will be adopted at a later time.
